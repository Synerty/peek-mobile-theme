#.  Data must be

    #.  Readable in daylight

    #.  Without transparent backgrounds

#.  Other screens must have static background to avoid distractions

#.  Large icons with text in the icons on home page

#.  Home page icons need to be more like apple icons

#.  Home page design must be impressive

#.  Use Nodal background as used in Peek App Branding

    for each App can change when a user clicks into it, hence having its own subtle
    branding but still share allot of common elements in the entire app.
