Overview
========

The Peek Mobile Theme will style the Peek app built upon :ref:`overview_bootstrap`.

The bootstrap classes that are related to the layouts will only work on HTML, not
NativeScript.  Therefore the theme will avoid selecting by bootstrap classes that are
related to layouts.

The looks and feel classes are to be used.  These will need to be styled from scratch
for NativeScript.

.. _overview_bootstrap:

Bootstrap
---------

The css for the peek app is based upon bootstrap. For more detailed reference to
bootstrap documentation please visit `BootStrap <http://getbootstrap.com>`_.

.. note:: NativeScript does not use :ref:`overview_bootstrap` for layout.
