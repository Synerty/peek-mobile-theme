Design Objective
----------------

The objective of this project is to stylise the existing layout to make it very
impressive without changing the HTML / javascript of a page to a large extent. The job
mainly involves CSS/SCSS upgrade to the base Bootstrap theme.

This app will be viewed predominately during the day. The design and layout must be
clear to read in very bright sunlight.

Design requirements

    #.  Readable in daylight

    #.  Without transparent backgrounds

#.  Large icons with text in the icons on home page

#.  Home page icons need to be more like apple icons

#.  Home page design must be impressive

#.  All screens do not need to have the same background

#.  Other screens must have static background to avoid distractions

#.  Use Nodal background as used in Peek App Branding

#.  Each icon on the home screen represents and App / Plugin and the background image
    for each App can change when a user clicks into it, hence having its own subtle
    branding but still share allot of common elements in the entire app.
